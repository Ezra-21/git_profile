# 💫 About Me:

🎓 I’m a passionate Software Engineering student with a strong interest in **problem solving**, **data science**, and **artificial intelligence**.  

🚀 My core focus right now is on building a solid foundation in:
- **Competitive programming** through platforms like **Codeforces** and **LeetCode**, where I regularly challenge myself with algorithmic problems.
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**, especially using **Python** and libraries like **NumPy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn** to build beginner-to-intermediate level projects.

💡 I believe strong problem-solving skills are the foundation for great software, whether it's optimizing algorithms, building web or mobile applications, or training a machine learning model.

🔍 I love exploring:
- Real-world applications of **AI & ML** in fields like recommendation systems, automation, and data-driven decision making.
- Clean and responsive UI/UX through **web** and **Flutter** mobile development.

🛠 I’m always working to improve my ability to think algorithmically and write efficient code, and I enjoy collaborating on:
- Open-source projects that use data to create insights.
- ML-driven applications that solve real-world problems.
- Problem-solving groups or challenges to grow faster together.

📚 Always learning something new from design patterns and systems thinking to machine learning models and SQL optimization.

🔭 I’m currently working on  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Exploring competitive programming problems on Codeforces and LeetCode.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Developing web and mobile app projects to strengthen my problem-solving and coding skills.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Building beginner-friendly machine learning projects using Python libraries.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Open-source projects related to web development, mobile apps (especially with Flutter), and educational ML projects.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Innovative ideas in data science and machine learning for beginners.

🤝 I’m looking for help with  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Strengthening my knowledge in ML algorithms and real-world Python ML libraries.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Enhancing my skills in solving complex algorithmic problems and building scalable applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Machine Learning fundamentals using Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Mobile application development with **Flutter & Dart**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Responsive web design and advanced CSS techniques  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• SQL, database normalization, and anomaly handling

💬 Ask me about  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Getting started with web dev, competitive programming, or app development  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• How I approach building projects and balancing university and personal learning  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Learning paths in data science and machine learning

⚡ Fun fact  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• I love turning ideas into apps and challenges into code  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• I enjoy simplifying complex tech topics for myself and others
